# Introduction to Async JavaScript

## Q1: What is Asynchronous JavaScript and why do we need it?

### How to Answer:

> "JavaScript is a single-threaded language, which means it can only execute one thing at a time. But if we had to wait for every operation to complete before moving to the next one - like waiting for a file to load or an API call to finish - our applications would freeze and become unusable.
>
> That's where asynchronous JavaScript comes in. It allows us to start long-running operations and continue executing other code while waiting for those operations to complete.
>
> For example, imagine you're making a request to fetch user data from a server. Without async code, your entire application would freeze until the server responds. With async code, you can make the request and continue doing other things - like handling user clicks or updating the UI - while waiting for the response.
>
> The main scenarios where we use async JavaScript are:
>
> - Making API calls with fetch or AJAX
> - Reading or writing files
> - Setting timers with setTimeout or setInterval
> - Database operations
> - Any operation that takes time and we don't want to block the main thread
>
> JavaScript achieves this using mechanisms like callbacks, promises, and async/await, all working together with the event loop."

### Key Point

> "Even though JavaScript is single-threaded, it can handle asynchronous operations by delegating time-consuming tasks to Web APIs and using the event loop to manage when their callbacks should run."

---

## Q2: What does it mean that JavaScript is single-threaded?

### How to Answer:

> "When we say JavaScript is single-threaded, it means it has only one call stack and can execute only one piece of code at a time. Think of it like having only one worker who can do only one task at a time.
>
> For example:"

```javascript
console.log("First");
console.log("Second");
console.log("Third");
```

> "These will always execute in order - First, Second, Third - because JavaScript processes them one by one on a single thread.
>
> However, this doesn't mean JavaScript can't handle multiple operations. The browser provides Web APIs that run outside of JavaScript's single thread - things like setTimeout, fetch, DOM events. These operations happen in the background, and when they're done, their callbacks are queued up to be executed on the main thread.
>
> So JavaScript itself is single-threaded, but it works in an environment (the browser or Node.js) that provides multi-threading capabilities for certain operations. The event loop coordinates everything to make it seem like multiple things are happening at once, even though JavaScript code itself only runs one thing at a time."

# Call Stack & Synchronous Execution

## Q3: What is the Call Stack and how does it work?

### How to Answer:

> "The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of function calls in your program. It works on a Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle - like a stack of plates where you can only add or remove from the top.
>
> When a function is called, it gets pushed onto the call stack. When the function returns, it gets popped off the stack.
>
> Let me show you with an example:"

```javascript
function third() {
  console.log("Third function");
}

function second() {
  third();
  console.log("Second function");
}

function first() {
  second();
  console.log("First function");
}

first();
```

> "Here's what happens step by step:
>
> 1. first() is called → pushed onto stack
> 2. Inside first(), second() is called → pushed onto stack
> 3. Inside second(), third() is called → pushed onto stack
> 4. third() executes and returns → popped off stack
> 5. Back in second(), console.log runs, then it returns → popped off stack
> 6. Back in first(), console.log runs, then it returns → popped off stack
> 7. Stack is empty
>
> The output would be:"

```text
Third function
Second function
First function
```

### Important point

> "JavaScript can only execute code when the call stack is not empty. When the stack is empty, it checks the task queue for any pending callbacks. This is how the event loop works."

---

## Q4: What happens when the call stack overflows?

### How to Answer:

> "A stack overflow happens when you have too many function calls on the stack, usually from infinite recursion - when a function keeps calling itself without a proper exit condition.
>
> For example:"

```javascript
function recurse() {
  recurse(); // Calls itself forever
}

recurse(); // Error: Maximum call stack size exceeded
```

> "Each call to recurse() adds a new frame to the call stack, but nothing ever gets popped off because the function never returns. Eventually, the stack runs out of space and JavaScript throws a 'Maximum call stack size exceeded' error.
>
> This is different from an infinite loop:"

```javascript
while (true) {
  console.log("Loop");
}
```

> "An infinite loop doesn't cause a stack overflow because it doesn't keep adding function calls to the stack. It just keeps executing the same code. But it will freeze your program because the call stack never becomes empty, so the event loop can't process other tasks.
>
> The way to avoid stack overflow is to always have a base case in recursive functions:"

```javascript
function countdown(n) {
  if (n <= 0) return; // Base case
  console.log(n);
  countdown(n - 1);
}

countdown(5); // Works fine
```

> "Now the recursion has an exit condition, so the stack doesn't grow infinitely."

# setTimeout & setInterval

## Q5: How does setTimeout work?

### How to Answer:

> "setTimeout is a function that executes a callback after a specified delay. The syntax is:"

```javascript
setTimeout(callback, delay);
```

> "For example:"

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("This runs after 2 seconds");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");
```

> "The output will be:"

```text
Start
End
This runs after 2 seconds
```

> "Notice that 'End' prints before the setTimeout callback, even though the setTimeout comes first in the code. This is because setTimeout is asynchronous.
>
> Here's what happens:
>
> 1. 'Start' is logged
> 2. setTimeout is called - it registers the callback with the Web API and sets a timer for 2000ms
> 3. JavaScript continues immediately to the next line (doesn't wait)
> 4. 'End' is logged
> 5. After 2 seconds, the callback is moved to the task queue
> 6. When the call stack is empty, the event loop picks up the callback and executes it
>
> Important points:
>
> The delay is not guaranteed to be exact. It's the minimum time before the callback can run. If the call stack is busy, the callback will have to wait:"

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Should run after 0ms");
}, 0);

// Some heavy operation
for (let i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {}

console.log("Heavy operation done");
```

> "Even with 0ms delay, the setTimeout callback runs after the loop finishes because the loop blocks the call stack."

---

## Q6: What's the difference between setTimeout and setInterval?

### How to Answer:

> "Both are timer functions, but they work differently:
>
> setTimeout - Executes the callback once after the specified delay:"

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Runs once after 2 seconds");
}, 2000);
```

> "setInterval - Executes the callback repeatedly at the specified interval:"

```javascript
setInterval(() => {
  console.log("Runs every 2 seconds");
}, 2000);
```

> "setInterval keeps running until you explicitly stop it using clearInterval:"

```javascript
const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
  console.log("Tick");
}, 1000);

// Stop after 5 seconds
setTimeout(() => {
  clearInterval(intervalId);
  console.log("Interval stopped");
}, 5000);
```

> "Important consideration: setInterval doesn't wait for the callback to finish before scheduling the next one. If your callback takes longer than the interval, you might have issues:"

```javascript
setInterval(() => {
  // If this takes 3 seconds but interval is 2 seconds,
  // calls can pile up
  someSlowOperation();
}, 2000);
```

> "A safer pattern is using setTimeout recursively:"

```javascript
function repeatTask() {
  someSlowOperation();
  setTimeout(repeatTask, 2000); // Schedule next call after this one finishes
}

repeatTask();
```

> "This ensures there's always a 2-second gap between the end of one call and the start of the next."

---

## Q7: What is setTimeout 0 and why would you use it?

### How to Answer:

> "setTimeout with 0 delay doesn't execute immediately - it defers the callback until after the current call stack is clear."
> "So setTimeout(0) is a way to say 'do this, but let everything else in the current stack finish first.'"

```javascript
console.log("1");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("2");
}, 0);

console.log("3");

// Output: 1, 3, 2
```

> "Even though the delay is 0, the callback still goes through the event loop. The synchronous code runs first, then the callback executes.
>
> Why use it?
>
> Use case 1: Breaking up long-running tasks"

> "This allows the browser to handle other tasks between chunks, keeping the UI responsive.

```javascript
function processLargeArray(array) {
  // Process in chunks to avoid blocking
  const chunk = array.splice(0, 100);

  // Process this chunk
  chunk.forEach((item) => processItem(item));

  // If more items, schedule next chunk
  if (array.length > 0) {
    setTimeout(() => processLargeArray(array), 0);
  }
}
```


>
> Use case 2: Deferring code until DOM is ready"

```javascript
// Sometimes you need to ensure DOM has updated
element.style.display = "block";

setTimeout(() => {
  // This runs after the browser has painted the change
  element.style.opacity = "1";
}, 0);
```

> "Use case 3: Changing execution order"




# Callbacks & Callback Hell

## Q8: What is a callback function?

### How to Answer:

> "A callback is simply a function that you pass as an argument to another function, and it gets called later - usually after some operation completes.
>
> The simplest example:"

```javascript
function greet(name, callback) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
  callback();
}

function sayGoodbye() {
  console.log("Goodbye!");
}

greet("John", sayGoodbye);

// Output:
// Hello John
// Goodbye!
```

> "Callbacks are heavily used in asynchronous operations because they allow you to specify what should happen after an async operation completes:"

```javascript
// Reading a file (async operation)
readFile("data.txt", function (error, data) {
  if (error) {
    console.log("Error reading file");
  } else {
    console.log("File content:", data);
  }
});

console.log("This runs before the file is read");
```

> "Here, the callback function is called once the file reading is complete. Meanwhile, JavaScript continues executing other code.
>
> Types of callbacks:
>
> Synchronous callbacks - Execute immediately:"

```javascript
[1, 2, 3].forEach(function (num) {
  console.log(num); // Runs immediately for each item
});
```

> "Asynchronous callbacks - Execute later:"

```javascript
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("Runs after 1 second"); // Runs later
}, 1000);
```

> "The key concept is that callbacks let you say 'when this is done, do that' - which is essential for handling async operations."

---

## Q9: What is Callback Hell and how do you avoid it?

### How to Answer:

> "Callback hell, also called 'pyramid of doom,' happens when you have multiple nested callbacks, making the code hard to read and maintain.
>
> Here's an example:"

```javascript
getData(function (a) {
  getMoreData(a, function (b) {
    getMoreData(b, function (c) {
      getMoreData(c, function (d) {
        getMoreData(d, function (e) {
          console.log("Finally done!");
        });
      });
    });
  });
});
```

> "Look at how the code keeps indenting to the right - that's the 'pyramid.' It's hard to read, hard to debug, and hard to handle errors.
>
> Problems with callback hell:
>
> - Hard to read - The logic is buried in nested functions
> - Error handling nightmare - You need to handle errors at each level
> - Hard to maintain - Adding or removing steps is difficult
> - Difficult to debug - Stack traces become confusing
>
> Solutions:
>
> Solution 1: Named functions"

```javascript
function step1(data, callback) {
  // Process data
  callback(null, processedData);
}

function step2(data, callback) {
  // Process data
  callback(null, processedData);
}

step1(initialData, function (err, result1) {
  if (err) return handleError(err);
  step2(result1, function (err, result2) {
    if (err) return handleError(err);
    // Continue...
  });
});
```

> "Solution 2: Promises (better)"

```javascript
getData()
  .then(getMoreData)
  .then(getMoreData)
  .then(getMoreData)
  .then((result) => {
    console.log("Done!", result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log("Error:", error);
  });
```

> "Solution 3: async/await (best)"

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const a = await getData();
    const b = await getMoreData(a);
    const c = await getMoreData(b);
    const d = await getMoreData(c);
    console.log("Done!", d);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("Error:", error);
  }
}
```

> "Modern JavaScript strongly favors promises and async/await over nested callbacks because they make async code look and behave more like synchronous code."

# Promises

## Q10: What is a Promise in JavaScript?

### How to Answer:

> "A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. Think of it as a placeholder for a value that we don't have yet but will have in the future.
>
> A promise can be in one of three states:
>
> - Pending - Initial state, the operation hasn't completed yet
> - Fulfilled - The operation completed successfully
> - Rejected - The operation failed
>
> Here's how you create a promise:" :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

```javascript
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Do some async operation
  setTimeout(() => {
    const success = true;

    if (success) {
      resolve("Operation successful!"); // Fulfilled
    } else {
      reject("Operation failed!"); // Rejected
    }
  }, 1000);
});
```

> "And here's how you use it:" :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

```javascript
myPromise
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result); // Runs if fulfilled
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error); // Runs if rejected
  });
```

> "Why promises are better than callbacks:
>
> - Cleaner syntax - No deep nesting
> - Better error handling - One .catch() can handle errors from any step
> - Chainable - You can chain multiple async operations easily
> - Built-in state management - The promise keeps track of whether it's pending, fulfilled, or rejected
>
> Important points:
>
> - A promise can only be resolved or rejected once - it can't change after that
> - You can't 'cancel' a promise once it's created
> - Promises always resolve or reject asynchronously, even if the operation is synchronous" :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Q11: How do you create and use Promises?

### How to Answer:

> "Creating a promise involves using the Promise constructor with an executor function that takes two parameters: resolve and reject.
>

  });
}

// Usage
console.log("Start");
delay(2000).then(() => {
  console.log("2 seconds later");
});
```

> "Key patterns:

## Q12: What's the difference between Promise.resolve() and Promise.reject()?

### How to Answer:

> "These are convenience methods for creating promises that are already fulfilled or rejected.
>
> Promise.resolve() - Creates a promise that's immediately fulfilled with a value:" :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

```javascript
const promise = Promise.resolve("Hello");

});

// Equivalent to:
const promise = new Promise((resolve) => {
  resolve("Hello");
});
```

> "Promise.reject() - Creates a promise that's immediately rejected with a reason:" :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

```javascript
const promise = Promise.reject("Something went wrong");

# Promise Methods

## Q13: Explain Promise.all() and when to use it.

### How to Answer:

> "Promise.all() takes an array of promises and returns a single promise that resolves when all the input promises have resolved, or rejects if any one of them rejects.
>
> Basic usage:" :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

```javascript

# async/await

## Q16: What is async/await and how does it work?

### How to Answer

"async/await is syntactic sugar built on top of promises that makes asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code. It makes async code easier to read and write.

When JavaScript encounters `await`, it pauses the execution of that async function, not the main thread.

Internally, the awaited value is wrapped using `Promise.resolve()`, and the remaining code is converted into a Promise continuation and placed in the microtask queue.

Once the Promise settles and the call stack is empty, the event loop picks the microtask and resumes execution.

This makes asynchronous code look synchronous while still being non-blocking."

### The `async` keyword

Declares that a function returns a promise:

```javascript
async function getData() {
  return "Hello"; // Automatically wrapped in Promise.resolve()
}
```

Equivalent to:

```javascript
function getData() {
  return Promise.resolve("Hello");
}
```

Usage:

```javascript
getData().then((value) => console.log(value)); // 'Hello'
```

### The `await` keyword

Pauses execution until a promise resolves:

```javascript
async function fetchUser() {
  const response = await fetch("/api/user");
  const user = await response.json();
  return user;
}
```

This is much cleaner than the promise chain equivalent:

```javascript
function fetchUser() {
  return fetch("/api/user")
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((user) => user);
}
```

# Q17: What are common mistakes with async/await?

## How to Answer

"There are several common mistakes people make with async/await:

### Mistake 1: Forgetting `await`

### Mistake 2: Using `await` in loops (making things sequential when they could be parallel)

### Mistake 3: Not handling errors

### Mistake 4: Using `async` when not needed

### Mistake 5: Not awaiting in `forEach`

### Mistake 6: Top-level `await` in wrong context"

# Error Handling in Async Code

## Q18: How do you handle errors in Promises?

### How to Answer

"There are several ways to handle errors in promises:

### Method 1: Using `.catch()`

```javascript
fetch("/api/user")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((user) => console.log(user))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Something went wrong:", error);
  });
```

The `.catch()` will catch any error that occurs in any of the `.then()` blocks above it.

### Method 2: Using `.finally()` for cleanup

```javascript
let loading = true;

fetch("/api/user")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((user) => {
    console.log(user);
    loading = false;
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    loading = false;
  })
  .finally(() => {
    // This runs whether success or failure
    console.log("Request completed");
  });
```

# Error Handling in Async Code

## Q19: How do you handle errors with async/await?

### How to Answer

"With async/await, we use `try/catch` blocks - just like regular synchronous code:

### Basic `try/catch`

```javascript
async function fetchUser() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("/api/user");
    const user = await response.json();
    return user;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching user:", error);
    throw error; // Re-throw if you want caller to handle it
  }
}
```

### Handling specific errors

```javascript
async function fetchUser(id) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);

    if (!response.ok) {
      if (response.status === 404) {
        throw new Error("User not found");
      } else if (response.status === 500) {
        throw new Error("Server error");
      }
    }

    const user = await response.json();
    return user;
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.message === "User not found") {
      console.error("No such user");
      return null;
    } else if (error.name === "TypeError") {
      console.error("Network error");
      return null;
    } else {
      console.error("Unexpected error:", error);
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

# fetch API

## Q20: How does the fetch API work?

### How to Answer

"The fetch API is a modern way to make HTTP requests in JavaScript. It returns a Promise that resolves to a Response object.

### Basic GET request

```javascript
fetch("https://api.example.com/users")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error("Error:", error));
```

### With `async/await`

```javascript
async function getUsers() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/users");
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
}
```

### Important: `fetch` only rejects on network errors, not HTTP errors

```javascript
async function fetchUser() {
  const response = await fetch("/api/user");

  // This is a 404 error, but fetch doesn't reject!
  // You need to check response.ok

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
  }

  const user = await response.json();
  return user;
}
```

# Event Loop

## Q21: What is the Event Loop and how does it work?

### How to Answer

It is concept of java script runtime.

The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that manages the execution of synchronous and asynchronous code. It continuously checks the call stack, processes microtasks first, then task que (macrotasks), allowing JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations efficiently despite being single-threaded. It's what makes asynchronous code possible.

### Here's how it works

### Components of the event loop

- **Call Stack** - Where JavaScript executes code
- **Web APIs** - Browser-provided APIs (`setTimeout`, `fetch`, DOM events)
- **Callback Queue (Task Queue)** - Where callbacks wait
- **Microtask Queue** - Priority queue for promises
- **Event Loop** - Checks if call stack is empty and moves tasks from queues

### The process

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("Promise");
});

console.log("End");

// Output: Start, End, Promise, Timeout
```

### Let me explain what happens step by step

1. Step 1: `console.log('Start')` executes → prints `'Start'`

2. Step 2: `setTimeout` is called → callback goes to Web API, which starts timer

3. Step 3: `Promise.resolve().then()` is called → callback goes to Microtask Queue

4. Step 4: `console.log('End')` executes → prints `'End'`

5. Step 5: Call stack is now empty, event loop checks queues

6. Step 6: Microtask queue has priority → Promise callback executes → prints `'Promise'`

7. Step 7: Timer completes → `setTimeout` callback moves from Web API to Callback Queue

8. Step 8: Event loop moves `setTimeout` callback to call stack → prints `'Timeout'`

### Visual representation

```text
Call Stack: [Currently executing code]
       ↓
  Is empty?
       ↓
Microtask Queue: [Promise callbacks] ← Higher priority
       ↓
Callback Queue: [setTimeout, events] ← Lower priority
       ↓
Back to Call Stack
```

### Why this order matters

```javascript
setTimeout(() => console.log("1"), 0);

Promise.resolve()
  .then(() => console.log("2"))
  .then(() => console.log("3"));

setTimeout(() => console.log("4"), 0);

// Output: 2, 3, 1, 4
// All promise callbacks run before any setTimeout
```

# Event Loop

## Q22: Can you explain the event loop with a diagram or step-by-step example?

It is concept of java script runtime.

The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that manages the execution of synchronous and

asynchronous code. It continuously checks the call stack, processes microtasks first, then task

que (macrotasks), allowing JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations efficiently.

### How to Answer

"Let me walk through a concrete example step by step:

```javascript
console.log("A");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("B");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("C");
});

console.log("D");
```

### Step-by-step breakdown

#### Initial State

```text
Call Stack: []
Microtask Queue: []
Callback Queue: []
```

#### Step 1: Execute `console.log('A')`

```text
Call Stack: [console.log('A')]
Output: 'A'
Call Stack: [] (after execution)
```

#### Step 2: Execute `setTimeout`

- `setTimeout` is called
- Web API starts `0ms` timer
- Callback moves to Web API, waiting for timer

```text
Call Stack: [] (setTimeout itself finishes immediately)
```

#### Step 3: Execute `Promise.resolve().then()`

- Promise is already resolved
- Callback goes to Microtask Queue

```text
Call Stack: []
Microtask Queue: [() => console.log('C')]
```

#### Step 4: Execute `console.log('D')`

```text
Call Stack: [console.log('D')]
Output: 'D'
Call Stack: [] (after execution)
```

#### Step 5: Call stack is empty - Event loop checks Microtask Queue

- Microtask Queue has callback from Promise
- Move to call stack and execute

```text
Call Stack: [() => console.log('C')]
Output: 'C'
Call Stack: []
Microtask Queue: []
```

#### Step 6: Timer completes (`0ms`)

- Callback moves from Web API to Callback Queue

```text
Callback Queue: [() => console.log('B')]
```

#### Step 7: Call stack empty, Microtask queue empty - Check Callback Queue

- Move `setTimeout` callback to call stack

```text
Call Stack: [() => console.log('B')]
Output: 'B'
Call Stack: []
```

### Final output

```text
A
D
C
B
```

# Microtasks vs Macrotasks

## Q23: What's the difference between Microtasks and Macrotasks?

### How to Answer

"Microtasks and macrotasks are two different types of asynchronous tasks in JavaScript, and they have different priorities in the event loop.

### Macrotasks (Task Queue)

- `setTimeout` callbacks
- `setInterval` callbacks
- `setImmediate` (Node.js)
- I/O operations
- UI rendering

### Microtasks (Microtask Queue)

- Promise callbacks (`.then`, `.catch`, `.finally`)
- `async/await`
- `queueMicrotask()`
- `MutationObserver` callbacks

### The key difference is priority

After each macrotask, ALL microtasks are processed before the next macrotask runs."

# Global Execution Context

## Q24: What is the Global Execution Context?

### How to Answer

"The Global Execution Context is the environment where your JavaScript code runs. When your code first starts executing, JavaScript creates the global execution context.

Think of it as the 'default' or 'base' environment for your code. Every JavaScript program has one global execution context.

### What happens when Global Execution Context is created

#### Phase 1: Creation Phase

- Creates the global object (`window` in browsers, `global` in Node.js)
- Sets up memory for variables and functions (hoisting)
- Initializes variables to `undefined`
- Stores function declarations in memory

#### Phase 2: Execution Phase

- Executes code line by line
- Assigns values to variables
- Executes function calls (creates new execution contexts)

### Example

```javascript
var name = "John";

function greet() {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
}

greet();
```

### During Creation Phase

- `name` is stored in memory and initialized to `undefined`
- `greet` function is stored in memory with its entire definition
- Global object (`window`) is created

### During Execution Phase

- Line 1: `name` is assigned `'John'`
- Line 3-5: `greet` function definition (already in memory, nothing to do)
- Line 7: `greet()` is called → New execution context created for `greet`

### Global vs Function Execution Context

```javascript
var globalVar = "global";

function outer() {
  var outerVar = "outer";

  function inner() {
    var innerVar = "inner";
    console.log(globalVar, outerVar, innerVar);
  }

  inner();
}

outer();
```

### Execution contexts created

1. Global Execution Context (has `globalVar`)
2. `outer()` Execution Context (has `outerVar`)
3. `inner()` Execution Context (has `innerVar`)

Each execution context has access to its own variables plus all outer contexts (scope chain).

### Global Object

#### In browsers

```javascript
var globalVar = "test";

console.log(window.globalVar); // 'test'
console.log(globalVar); // 'test'

// var creates properties on global object
```

### With `let`/`const`

```javascript
let notOnWindow = "test";

console.log(window.notOnWindow); // undefined
console.log(notOnWindow); // 'test'

// let/const don't create properties on global object
```

### `this` in Global Context

```javascript
console.log(this); // window (in browsers)

function regularFunction() {
  console.log(this); // window (in non-strict mode)
}

const arrowFunction = () => {
  console.log(this); // window (inherits from global)
};
```

The global execution context is the foundation of JavaScript's execution environment. Everything starts here."

# Closures in Async Context

## Q25: How do closures work with asynchronous code?

### How to Answer

A closure is created when a function “remembers” variables from its lexical scope even after the outer function has finished execution.

- JavaScript closures provide data privacy without classes.
- Closures allow encapsulation by hiding variables from the outside world.
- Closures prevent garbage collection of variables they reference.
- JavaScript closures provide data privacy without classes.
- Closures allow encapsulation by hiding variables from the outside world.
- Closures prevent garbage collection of variables they reference

```javascript
function outer() {
  let count = 0;

  function inner() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  }

  return inner;
}

const fn = outer();

fn(); // 1
fn(); // 2
```

### Common interview question - Loop with `setTimeout`

#### Problem: What does this print?

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(i);
  }, 1000);
}

// Output: 3, 3, 3 (all print 3!)
```

Why?

Because `var` is function-scoped, all three callbacks reference the same `i`. By the time they execute, the loop has finished and `i` is `3`.

### Solution 1: Use `let` (block-scoped)

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(i);
  }, 1000);
}

// Output: 0, 1, 2
```

With `let`, each iteration creates a new block scope with its own `i`.

### Solution 2: Use IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  (function (j) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(j);
    }, 1000);
  })(i);
}

// Output: 0, 1, 2
```

The IIFE creates a new scope for each iteration, capturing the current value of `i` as `j`.

### Solution 3: Pass parameter to `setTimeout`

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(
    (i) => {
      console.log(i);
    },
    1000,
    i,
  ); // Third argument passes i to callback
}

// Output: 0, 1, 2
```

### Closures with event handlers

```javascript
function createButtons() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    const button = document.createElement("button");
    button.textContent = `Button ${i}`;

    button.addEventListener("click", () => {
      console.log(`Button ${i} clicked`); // Closure captures i
    });

    document.body.appendChild(button);
  }
}
```

Each event handler has its own closure capturing its respective `i` value.

### Practical async example

```javascript
function fetchUserData(userId) {
  const startTime = Date.now();

  return fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`)
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((user) => {
      const elapsed = Date.now() - startTime;
      console.log(`Fetched ${user.name} in ${elapsed}ms`);
      // Closure allows access to startTime and userId
      return user;
    });
}
```

### Memory consideration

```javascript
function createHeavyCallback() {
  const hugeArray = new Array(1000000).fill("data");

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Done");
    // Closure keeps hugeArray in memory even though we don't use it!
  }, 1000);
}
```

> Be careful - closures keep all outer scope variables in memory, even if unused. This can cause memory leaks with large data.
> Closures are fundamental to JavaScript and essential for understanding how async callbacks work.

# this Keyword with Callbacks

## Q26: How does the 'this' keyword work in callbacks?

### How to Answer

`this` refers to the object that invokes the function.

"The `this` keyword in JavaScript is tricky, especially in callbacks, because its value depends on how the function is called, not where it's defined.

### Problem with regular functions as callbacks

```javascript
const user = {
  name: "John",
  greet: function () {
    console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
  },
};

user.greet(); // 'Hello, John' - works fine

setTimeout(user.greet, 1000); // 'Hello, undefined'
// this.name is undefined because 'this' is now window/global
```

When you pass `user.greet` to `setTimeout`, it loses its connection to `user`. The function is called without any object context, so `this` becomes the global object (or `undefined` in strict mode).

### Solution 1: Arrow functions

```javascript
const user = {
  name: "John",
  greet: function () {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
      // Arrow function doesn't have its own 'this'
      // It uses 'this' from the outer scope (user)
    }, 1000);
  },
};

user.greet(); // 'Hello, John' after 1 second
```

Arrow functions don't have their own `this` - they inherit it from the surrounding scope.

### Solution 2: `bind()`

```javascript
const user = {
  name: "John",
  greet: function () {
    console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
  },
};

setTimeout(user.greet.bind(user), 1000);
// bind() creates a new function with 'this' permanently set to user
```

### Solution 3: Wrapper function

```javascript
setTimeout(() => user.greet(), 1000);
// The wrapper function calls greet() on user object
```

### Solution 4: Store `this` in a variable

```javascript
const user = {
  name: "John",
  greet: function () {
    const self = this; // Store reference

    setTimeout(function () {
      console.log("Hello, " + self.name);
    }, 1000);
  },
};
```

### Event handlers

```javascript
class Button {
  constructor(label) {
    this.label = label;
  }

  // Problem
  handleClick() {
    console.log(this.label); // 'this' is the button element!
  }

  // Solution 1: Arrow function
  handleClickArrow = () => {
    console.log(this.label); // Correct 'this'
  }

  // Solution 2: Bind in constructor
  constructor(label) {
    this.label = label;
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }
}

const btn = new Button('Click me');

document
  .querySelector('button')
  .addEventListener('click', btn.handleClick);
```

### Promises and `this`

```javascript
class DataFetcher {
  constructor() {
    this.data = null;
  }

  // Problem
  fetchData() {
    fetch("/api/data").then(function (response) {
      this.data = response; // Error! 'this' is undefined
    });
  }

  // Solution 1: Arrow function
  fetchData() {
    fetch("/api/data").then((response) => {
      this.data = response; // Correct!
    });
  }

  // Solution 2: Store this
  fetchData() {
    const self = this;

    fetch("/api/data").then(function (response) {
      self.data = response; // Works
    });
  }
}
```

### `async/await` and `this`

```javascript
class API {
  constructor() {
    this.baseURL = "https://api.example.com";
  }

  async fetchUser(id) {
    // async functions preserve 'this' context
    const response = await fetch(`${this.baseURL}/users/${id}`);
    return response.json();
  }

  // But be careful when passing methods as callbacks
  async loadUser(id) {
    const user = await this.fetchUser(id);
    // This works when called directly
    // But would fail if passed as callback without binding
  }
}

const api = new API();

setTimeout(api.loadUser, 1000); // Error!
setTimeout(() => api.loadUser(1), 1000); // Works
setTimeout(api.loadUser.bind(api, 1), 1000); // Works
```

> General rule: Use arrow functions for callbacks when you need to preserve `this` from the outer scope. They're the modern, clean solution."

# Modules (import/export)

## Q27: What are ES6 modules and how do import/export work?

### How to Answer

"ES6 modules are a way to organize and share code between files. Before modules, we had to use script tags or build tools. Now JavaScript has a native module system.

### Named Exports

```javascript
// math.js
export const add = (a, b) => a + b;
export const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;

export function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

const divide = (a, b) => a / b;
export { divide };
```

### Importing

```javascript
import { add, subtract, multiply } from "./math.js";

console.log(add(5, 3)); // 8
```

### Default Export

```javascript
// user.js
export default class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```

Or

```javascript
const config = { theme: "dark" };
export default config;
```

### Importing

```javascript
import User from "./user.js"; // Can name it anything
import AppConfig from "./user.js"; // Same file, different name
```

### Mixing named and default

```javascript
// api.js
export default function fetchData() {
  // Main function
}

export const API_URL = "https://api.example.com";
export const timeout = 5000;
```

### Importing

```javascript
import fetchData, { API_URL, timeout } from "./api.js";
```

### Import everything as an object

```javascript
// math.js
export const add = (a, b) => a + b;
export const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;
```

### Importing

```javascript
import * as math from "./math.js";

console.log(math.add(5, 3)); // 8
console.log(math.subtract(5, 3)); // 2
```

### Renaming imports

```javascript
import { add as addition, subtract as subtraction } from "./math.js";

console.log(addition(5, 3)); // 8
```

### Re-exporting

```javascript
// utils/index.js
export { add, subtract } from "./math.js";
export { formatDate } from "./date.js";
export { default as User } from "./user.js";
```

### Now can import from one place

```javascript
import { add, formatDate, User } from "./utils/index.js";
```

### Dynamic imports (code splitting)

```javascript
// Load module conditionally
async function loadModule() {
  if (condition) {
    const module = await import("./heavy-module.js");
    module.doSomething();
  }
}
```

```javascript
// Load on user action
button.addEventListener("click", async () => {
  const { default: Chart } = await import("./chart.js");
  new Chart(data);
});
```

### Key differences from CommonJS

```javascript
// CommonJS (Node.js)
const module = require("./module");
module.exports = { something };
```

```javascript
// ES6 Modules
import module from "./module.js";
export default { something };
```

### Important points

- Static imports are hoisted - they run before any other code in the file
- Imports are read-only - you can't reassign them
- Imports are live bindings - if the exported value changes, imports see the change
- Use `.js` extension in imports (browsers require it)
- Module scope - variables in modules are private by default

### Using in HTML

```html
<!-- Add type="module" to script tag -->
<script type="module" src="app.js"></script>

# CommonJS vs ES6 Modules

## Q28: What's the difference between CommonJS and ES6 modules?

### How to Answer

"CommonJS and ES6 modules are two different module systems. CommonJS is the older system used in Node.js, while ES6 modules are the modern JavaScript standard.

### Syntax difference

#### CommonJS

```javascript
const module = require("./module");
const { specific } = require("./module");

module.exports = { something };
exports.something = value;
```

#### ES6 Modules

```javascript
import module from "./module.js";
import { specific } from "./module.js";

export default { something };
export const something = value;
```

### Key differences

#### 1. Loading: Synchronous vs Asynchronous

CommonJS loads modules synchronously:

```javascript
const fs = require("fs"); // Blocks until loaded
console.log("Loaded");
```

ES6 modules load asynchronously:

```javascript
import fs from "fs"; // Non-blocking
console.log("Loaded");
```

#### 2. Timing: Runtime vs Parse time

CommonJS: Modules are loaded at runtime

```javascript
if (condition) {
  const module = require("./module"); // Can be conditional
}
```

ES6: Imports are static and hoisted

```javascript
if (condition) {
  import module from "./module"; // Syntax error!
}
```

Must use dynamic import for conditional loading:

```javascript
if (condition) {
  const module = await import("./module.js"); // Works
}
```

#### 3. Values: Copies vs Live bindings

CommonJS exports copies:

```javascript
// counter.js
let count = 0;

module.exports = {
  count,
  increment() {
    count++;
  },
};

// main.js
const counter = require("./counter");

console.log(counter.count); // 0
counter.increment();
console.log(counter.count); // Still 0! (copy, not live)
```

ES6 exports live bindings:

```javascript
// counter.js
export let count = 0;

export function increment() {
  count++;
}

// main.js
import { count, increment } from "./counter.js";

console.log(count); // 0
increment();
console.log(count); // 1 (live binding!)
```

#### 4. Tree shaking

ES6 modules support tree shaking (dead code elimination):

```javascript
// With ES6 modules, bundlers can detect unused exports
import { add } from "./math.js"; // Only 'add' gets bundled
```

```javascript
// CommonJS imports everything
const { add } = require("./math.js"); // Whole module bundled
```

#### 5. `this` keyword

CommonJS: `this` refers to `module.exports`

```javascript
console.log(this === module.exports); // true
```

ES6: `this` is `undefined` in modules

```javascript
console.log(this); // undefined
```

#### 6. File extensions

CommonJS: `.js` files are CommonJS by default in Node

```javascript
require("./file"); // .js assumed
```

ES6: Needs `.mjs` or `"type": "module"` in `package.json`

```javascript
import "./file.js"; // Extension required in browsers
```

### Current state in Node.js

Node.js now supports both:

```json
// package.json
{
  "type": "module"
}
```

```text
// Makes .js files ES6 modules
```

Or use `.mjs` for ES6, `.cjs` for CommonJS.

### Interoperability

```javascript
// Can import CommonJS in ES6
import module from "./commonjs-module.js";
```

```javascript
// Cannot require() ES6 modules in CommonJS
// Must use dynamic import
const module = await import("./es6-module.js");
```

### Which to use

- Frontend: Always ES6 modules
- Node.js: ES6 modules are now recommended
- Legacy code: Still uses CommonJS

> ES6 modules are the future. They're more powerful, better optimized, and work everywhere."

# NPM & NPX Basics

## Q29: What are NPM and NPX? What's the difference?

### How to Answer

"NPM and NPX are both Node.js tools, but they serve different purposes.

### NPM (Node Package Manager)

NPM is a package manager for JavaScript. It helps you install, manage, and share code packages.

### NPX (Node Package Execute)

NPX is a tool for executing packages without installing them globally.

### Key differences

#### NPM

```bash
# Install first
npm install -g create-react-app

# Then use
create-react-app my-app
```

#### NPX

```bash
# Execute directly without installing
npx create-react-app my-app

# Runs the latest version each time
```

### Why use NPX

1. No global installations polluting your system
2. Always use latest version
3. Try packages without installing
4. Run different versions

### Summary

- **NPM:** Package manager for installing and managing dependencies.
- **NPX:** Package executor for running packages without installing them.

> In modern workflows, you use NPM for dependencies your project needs, and NPX for one-time commands and tools."

# Throttling & Debouncing

## Q30: What is Debouncing? Implement it.

### How to Answer

Debouncing makes sure a function runs only after an event stops.

If the event keeps happening, the function does **NOT** run.

### Why we use it?



- To avoid unnecessary function calls
- To improve performance
- To prevent multiple API calls

### Common use cases

- Search input - Wait for user to stop typing
- Window resize - Recalculate layout after resizing stops
- Form validation - Validate after user finishes input
- Save draft - Auto-save after user stops editing
- API calls - Reduce unnecessary requests

### How Debounce Works (Logic)

1. Event happens
2. Old timer is cleared
3. New timer starts
4. If no new event happens → function runs

### Use case: Search input that calls an API

#### Without debouncing

```javascript
// User types 'hello'
// API called: 'h'
// API called: 'he'
// API called: 'hel'
// API called: 'hell'
// API called: 'hello'

// 5 unnecessary API calls!
```

#### With debouncing

```javascript
// User types 'hello'
// Wait 300ms after last keystroke
// API called once: 'hello'
```

### Implementation

```javascript
function debounce(func, delay) {
  let timeoutId;

  return function (...args) {
    // Clear previous timer
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);

    // Set new timer
    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
      func.apply(this, args);
    }, delay);
  };
}
```

### Usage

```javascript
// Search function
function searchAPI(query) {
  console.log("Searching for:", query);
  // API call here
}

// Create debounced version
const debouncedSearch = debounce(searchAPI, 300);

// In event handler
input.addEventListener("input", (e) => {
  debouncedSearch(e.target.value);
});

// Now it only calls API 300ms after user stops typing
```

### Step 1: Create debounce function

#### `debounce.js`

```javascript
export function debounce(callback, delay) {
  let timer;

  return function (...args) {
    clearTimeout(timer);

    timer = setTimeout(() => {
      callback(...args);
    }, delay);
  };
}
```

### Step 2: `App.jsx`

```jsx
import { useEffect, useMemo, useState } from "react";
import { debounce } from "./debounce";

function App() {
  const [search, setSearch] = useState("");
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  // API Call
  const fetchPosts = async (searchText) => {
    setLoading(true);

    try {
      const response = await fetch(
        "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts",
      );

      const data = await response.json();

      const filteredPosts = data.filter((post) =>
        post.title.toLowerCase().includes(searchText.toLowerCase()),
      );

      setPosts(filteredPosts);
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error);
    }

    setLoading(false);
  };

  // Debounced version of API call
  const debouncedSearch = useMemo(() => {
    return debounce(fetchPosts, 500);
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    debouncedSearch(search);
  }, [search]);

  return (
    <div style={{ padding: "40px" }}>
      <h1>Search Posts</h1>

      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Search title..."
        value={search}
        onChange={(e) => setSearch(e.target.value)}
        style={{
          width: "400px",
          padding: "10px",
          fontSize: "16px",
        }}
      />

      <br />
      <br />

      {loading && <h3>Loading...</h3>}

      {!loading &&
        posts.map((post) => (
          <div
            key={post.id}
            style={{
              border: "1px solid gray",
              padding: "15px",
              marginBottom: "15px",
            }}
          >
            <h3>{post.title}</h3>
            <p>{post.body}</p>
          </div>
        ))}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

# Throttling & Debouncing

## Q31: What is Throttling? How is it different from Debouncing?

### How to Answer

Throttling ensures a function runs at most once in a given time interval, no matter how many times the event fires.

### Difference from Debouncing

#### Debouncing: "Wait until activity stops"

- Only executes after quiet period
- Good for: search, form validation, resize events

#### Throttling: "Execute at regular intervals"

- Executes at fixed rate
- Good for: scroll, mouse move, continuous events

### Implementation

```javascript
function throttle(func, limit) {
  let inThrottle;

  return function (...args) {
    if (!inThrottle) {
      func.apply(this, args);
      inThrottle = true;

      setTimeout(() => {
        inThrottle = false;
      }, limit);
    }
  };
}
```

### Step 1: Create Throttle Function

#### `throttle.js`

```javascript
export function throttle(callback, delay) {
  let lastCall = 0;

  return function (...args) {
    const now = Date.now();

    if (now - lastCall >= delay) {
      lastCall = now;
      callback(...args);
    }
  };
}
```

### Step 2: Infinite Scroll Example

```jsx
import { useEffect, useMemo, useState } from "react";
import { throttle } from "./throttle";

export default function App() {
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);
  const [page, setPage] = useState(1);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  // Fetch posts
  const fetchPosts = async (pageNumber) => {
    setLoading(true);

    const response = await fetch(
      `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?_page=${pageNumber}&_limit=10`,
    );

    const data = await response.json();

    setPosts((prev) => [...prev, ...data]);

    setLoading(false);
  };

  // Initial Load
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchPosts(page);
  }, []);

  // Load next page
  const loadMore = () => {
    if (loading) return;

    const reachedBottom =
      window.innerHeight + window.scrollY >=
      document.documentElement.scrollHeight - 100;

    if (reachedBottom) {
      const nextPage = page + 1;
      setPage(nextPage);
      fetchPosts(nextPage);
    }
  };

  // Throttle scroll handler
  const throttledScroll = useMemo(
    () => throttle(loadMore, 300),
    [page, loading],
  );

  useEffect(() => {
    window.addEventListener("scroll", throttledScroll);

    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener("scroll", throttledScroll);
    };
  }, [throttledScroll]);

  return (
    <div style={{ padding: 20 }}>
      <h1>Infinite Scroll Example</h1>

      {posts.map((post) => (
        <div
          key={post.id}
          style={{
            border: "1px solid gray",
            marginBottom: 10,
            padding: 10,
          }}
        >
          <h3>{post.title}</h3>
          <p>{post.body}</p>
        </div>
      ))}

      {loading && <h2>Loading...</h2>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Common use cases

#### Throttling

- Infinite scroll - Load more items as user scrolls
- Mouse tracking - Update cursor position
- Game loop - Limit frame rate
- Button clicks - Prevent spam clicking
- Progress bar updates - Smooth updates without overload

# Common Patterns & Best Practices

## Q33: What are some async/await best practices?

### How to Answer

"Here are the key best practices for writing async/await code:

### 1. Always handle errors with `try/catch`

#### Bad

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  const data = await fetch("/api/data");
  return data; // Errors will crash
}
```

#### Good

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const data = await fetch("/api/data");
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
    throw error; // Or handle gracefully
  }
}
```

### 2. Run independent operations in parallel

#### Bad - Sequential (3 seconds total)

```javascript
async function loadData() {
  const users = await fetchUsers(); // 1 sec
  const posts = await fetchPosts(); // 1 sec
  const comments = await fetchComments(); // 1 sec

  return { users, posts, comments };
}
```

#### Good - Parallel (1 second total)

```javascript
async function loadData() {
  const [users, posts, comments] = await Promise.all([
    fetchUsers(),
    fetchPosts(),
    fetchComments(),
  ]);

  return { users, posts, comments };
}
```

### 3. Use `Promise.allSettled` for partial failures

```javascript
async function loadDashboard() {
  const results = await Promise.allSettled([
    fetchUsers(),
    fetchPosts(),
    fetchStats(),
  ]);

  const users = results[0].status === "fulfilled" ? results[0].value : [];
  const posts = results[1].status === "fulfilled" ? results[1].value : [];
  const stats = results[2].status === "fulfilled" ? results[2].value : null;

  return { users, posts, stats };
}
```

### 4. Avoid async in array methods (`forEach`, `map`, `filter`)

#### Bad - doesn't wait

```javascript
users.forEach(async (user) => {
  await updateUser(user); // Doesn't actually wait!
});
```

#### Good - use `for...of`

```javascript
for (const user of users) {
  await updateUser(user);
}
```

#### Or `Promise.all` for parallel

```javascript
await Promise.all(users.map((user) => updateUser(user)));
```

### 5. Return promises directly when possible

#### Unnecessary `async/await`

```javascript
async function getUser(id) {
  return await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);
}
```

#### Better - just return the promise

```javascript
function getUser(id) {
  return fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);
}
```

#### Only use `async` if you need to await something

```javascript
async function getUser(id) {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);
  return response.json(); // Need await here
}
```

### 6. Use descriptive error messages

```javascript
async function fetchUser(id) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Failed to fetch user ${id}: ${response.status}`);
    }

    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error fetching user ${id}:`, error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### 7. Create helper functions for repeated patterns

#### Generic fetch wrapper

```javascript
async function apiRequest(url, options = {}) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url, {
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        ...options.headers,
      },
      ...options,
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}: ${response.statusText}`);
    }

    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("API request failed:", error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

#### Usage is much cleaner

```javascript
const user = await apiRequest("/api/users/1");

const newPost = await apiRequest("/api/posts", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({ title: "Hello" }),
});
```

### 8. Clean up async operations in `useEffect` (React)

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  let cancelled = false;

  async function fetchData() {
    try {
      const data = await fetch("/api/data");

      if (!cancelled) {
        setData(data);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      if (!cancelled) {
        setError(error);
      }
    }
  }

  fetchData();

  return () => {
    cancelled = true; // Cleanup
  };
}, []);
```

### 9. Use timeout wrappers for reliability

```javascript
async function fetchWithTimeout(url, timeout = 5000) {
  const controller = new AbortController();

  const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), timeout);

  try {
    const response = await fetch(url, {
      signal: controller.signal,
    });

    clearTimeout(timeoutId);

    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.name === "AbortError") {
      throw new Error("Request timeout");
    }

    throw error;
  }
}
```

### 10. Retry failed requests

```javascript
async function fetchWithRetry(url, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(url);
      return await response.json();
    } catch (error) {
      if (i === maxRetries - 1) throw error;

      // Wait before retry (exponential backoff)
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000 * (i + 1)));

      console.log(`Retry ${i + 1}/${maxRetries}`);
    }
  }
}
```

Following these practices makes async code more reliable, maintainable, and performant."

# Common Async Interview Questions / Problems

## Q34: What are common async interview questions/problems?

### How to Answer

"Here are some common async problems you might see in interviews:

### 1. Implement `promiseAll`

```javascript
function promiseAll(promises) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (promises.length === 0) {
      resolve([]);
      return;
    }

    const results = [];
    let completed = 0;

    promises.forEach((promise, index) => {
      Promise.resolve(promise)
        .then((value) => {
          results[index] = value;
          completed++;

          if (completed === promises.length) {
            resolve(results);
          }
        })
        .catch(reject);
    });
  });
}
```

#### Usage

```javascript
promiseAll([Promise.resolve(1), Promise.resolve(2), Promise.resolve(3)]).then(
  (results) => console.log(results),
); // [1, 2, 3]
```

### 2. Implement sequential promise execution

```javascript
async function executeSequentially(promises) {
  const results = [];

  for (const promise of promises) {
    const result = await promise();
    results.push(result);
  }

  return results;
}
```

#### Usage

```javascript
const tasks = [
  () => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000)),
  () => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve(2), 500)),
  () => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve(3), 1500)),
];

executeSequentially(tasks).then(console.log); // [1, 2, 3] after 3 seconds total
```

### 3. Retry mechanism

```javascript
async function retry(fn, maxAttempts = 3, delay = 1000) {
  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxAttempts; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await fn();
    } catch (error) {
      if (attempt === maxAttempts) {
        throw error;
      }

      console.log(`Attempt ${attempt} failed, retrying...`);
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
    }
  }
}
```

#### Usage

```javascript
retry(() => fetch("/api/data"))
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error("All attempts failed:", error));
```

### 4. Rate limiter

```javascript
function rateLimiter(fn, maxCalls, timeWindow) {
  const queue = [];
  let callsInWindow = 0;

  return async function (...args) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      const execute = async () => {
        try {
          callsInWindow++;

          const result = await fn(...args);
          resolve(result);

          setTimeout(() => {
            callsInWindow--;

            if (queue.length > 0) {
              const next = queue.shift();
              next();
            }
          }, timeWindow);
        } catch (error) {
          reject(error);
        }
      };

      if (callsInWindow < maxCalls) {
        execute();
      } else {
        queue.push(execute);
      }
    });
  };
}
```

#### Usage

```javascript
// Max 3 calls per second
const limitedFetch = rateLimiter(fetch, 3, 1000);
```

### 5. Implement sleep/delay

```javascript
function sleep(ms) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}
```

#### Usage

```javascript
async function demo() {
  console.log("Start");
  await sleep(2000);
  console.log("2 seconds later");
}
```

### 6. Race with timeout

```javascript
async function fetchWithTimeout(url, timeout) {
  return Promise.race([
    fetch(url),
    new Promise((_, reject) =>
      setTimeout(() => reject(new Error("Timeout")), timeout),
    ),
  ]);
}
```

#### Usage

```javascript
fetchWithTimeout("/api/data", 5000)
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error(error.message));
```

### 7. Batch requests

```javascript
async function batchRequests(items, batchSize, processFn) {
  const results = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i += batchSize) {
    const batch = items.slice(i, i + batchSize);

    const batchResults = await Promise.all(batch.map(processFn));

    results.push(...batchResults);
  }

  return results;
}
```

#### Usage

```javascript
const items = Array.from({ length: 100 }, (_, i) => i);

const results = await batchRequests(items, 10, async (item) => {
  return await fetch(`/api/item/${item}`).then((r) => r.json());
});
```

### 8. Debounced async function

```javascript
function debounceAsync(fn, delay) {
  let timeoutId;
  let pendingPromise = null;

  return function (...args) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);

    if (pendingPromise) {
      // Cancel previous promise
      pendingPromise = null;
    }

    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      timeoutId = setTimeout(async () => {
        try {
          const result = await fn(...args);
          resolve(result);
        } catch (error) {
          reject(error);
        }
      }, delay);
    });
  };
}
```

### 9. Implement `Promise.race`

```javascript
function promiseRace(promises) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    promises.forEach((promise) => {
      Promise.resolve(promise).then(resolve).catch(reject);
    });
  });
}
```

### 10. Parallel execution with limit

```javascript
async function parallelLimit(tasks, limit) {
  const results = [];
  const executing = [];

  for (const [index, task] of tasks.entries()) {
    const promise = Promise.resolve().then(() => task());

    results[index] = promise;

    if (limit <= tasks.length) {
      const e = promise.then(() => {
        executing.splice(executing.indexOf(e), 1);
      });

      executing.push(e);

      if (executing.length >= limit) {
        await Promise.race(executing);
      }
    }
  }

  return Promise.all(results);
}
```

#### Usage

```javascript
const tasks = Array.from(
  { length: 10 },
  (_, i) => () => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve(i), 1000)),
);

parallelLimit(tasks, 3).then(console.log);
```
